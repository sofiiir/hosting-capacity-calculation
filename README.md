# Hosting capacity calculations

Recreating the hosting capacity calculations based on [Brockway et. al's (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-021-00887-6) methodology, which was found in [Supplementary Table 4](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-021-00887-6/MediaObjects/41560_2021_887_MOESM1_ESM.pdf). 

A comprehensive list of this project's data sources can be found on the [GitHub organization's README](https://github.com/ElectriGrid).

### Folder description

**final**: Final hosting capacity calculation performed on each IOU. Notebooks differ in the application of customer use data onto generation values (because each IOU stores the data differently). For example, PG&E's customer breakdown had to be coverted from counts to percentages first.

**initial_attempts:** Contains different versions of hosting capacity calculations, one based on PG&E and the other on SDGE IOUs. Specifically, comparing methodology internally, comparing with Brockway et al.'s results, and graphing.
- **images:** Contains example plot from Brockway et al., which `pge_brockway_check.ipynb` attempts to replicate.
- **outputs:** Log outputs from running .py scripts in tmux.
- **py scripts:** .py scripts used to run hosting capacity calculations on different areas of California. This was completed as part of the validation step.
